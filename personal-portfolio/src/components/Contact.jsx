      Welcome! <br />
      I am Christopher Calixte, and I'm a student with a strong passion for computer science.
      I'm especially interested in software development, cloud computing, cybersecurity, 
      computer networks, system administration, and applied statistics.
      I value self-accountability and believe in continuous growth, 
      both personally and professionally.
